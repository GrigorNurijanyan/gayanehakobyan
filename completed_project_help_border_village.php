                    <p>2001-2003 implemented the Help to Neighboring Villages Program, which resulted in neighboring villages in Zedea, New York, Knowing God as the Lord and Loving Father of the universe, they prayed and The 10 to 12 years of drought have elapsed, villages have flourished, roads have been repaired and conditions have been created to open jobs.</p>
                    <p>
The people who lived between these rocks and the sky had preserved the quality of perceiving the beauty. They had a vivid face, They lived in pitiful houses, but they had not lost the majesty of their souls. There was life among them. God knows whom to help. True, Zedekiah's people were in poverty, but they did not need mercy, but help to stand up and help others.</p>
