                    <p>For Armenia, it was the period When the Communist society had already collapsed, a new, independent Armenia, continued the Arab War, which caused Armenia to be blocked. Factories were closed, and because of the lack of electricity, the public was in darkness.</p>
                    <p>Pyongyang and the surrounding regions were filled with Armenians emigrating from Azerbaijan and the victims of the 1988 Spitaki earthquake (the earthquake caused thousands of casualties in Armenia, three cities and many villages were destroyed. There was widespread famine, unemployment, round-the-clock bread queues.</p>

                    <p>I for the foundation and subsequent activities, Because, unlike charities operating in Armenia who received help from abroad, the financing of this service was to be carried out by the Armenian people who were blocked and starved with their donations.</p>
                    <p>The shepherd of the Church preached Mark 6:30–44 how Jesus fed more than 50,000 people in the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>Release them, that the dogs and villages on the four sides should go for bread for themselves, because they have nothing to eat here. ... He told them: "You will be with me in </p>

                    <p>The shepherd's sermon taught churches to trust in God. what's going to multiply, and in those hunger conditions, not only themselves but many and many people will be fed.</p>
                    <p>The next day, as Jesus' disciples returned, bringing five breads and two fish (which he had given a little boy from the crowd), each of the church members brought what he had—one pound [1 kg] of sugar, half a pound of rice, and clothing. But the most shocking was the first donation, one fingerprint bread, Sacrifices were divided into war and earthquake victims.</p>
                    <p>God appreciated the sacrifices of church members and blessed them so much that they were able to support charity servants to implement a number of projects.</p>
