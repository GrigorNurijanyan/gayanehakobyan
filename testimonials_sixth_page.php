                    God’s supernatural miracles are inexhaustible in the lives of each of us. In my life, a miracle was not delayed as well.

                    My name is Ruzanna Boyakhchyan. I have had a lot of downfalls in my life. From my childhood, I experienced the feeling of alienation from my own mother. I used to feel hunger for days. Since my childhood, I was rejected and ignored by many. My first marriage ended after 18 years, because of my barrenness. After the divorce, all my relatives rejected me. At that period, I had serious health issues; I was diagnosed with a non-cancerous growth in my breast, and I was operated.

                    Serious health issues and rejection from my family resulted in deep disappointment. In that state, I had a hasty marriage. At the age of 40, after 20 years of barrenness, God gave me a wonderful daughter. Unfortunately, when my daughter was 5, her father left us. We were left in a forsaken place, a guard booth in a car cemetery, with no utilities. With my daughter, we brought water from a large water channel that was very far from us; each time we had to endanger our lives for water. However, it was not the worst thing. The dilapidated place where we lived belonged to a person who was forcing us leave it speedily. He started threatening us, and even started to demolish the place. I applied to the city hall and to other high-ranking officials, requesting them to allow us to stay there, but in no avail. One time, I even tried to end our lives, as we had no hope in life.

                    My neighbor was a believer, and one day, she told me about Jesus. She attended the Word of Life Church. Soon I met other members of the Church. They enrolled us in the Development Center of “Go and See…” Social Ministry. I met the leader of the Center Geghetsik Sahakyan and other workers, who received us with great love and warmth. We started to visit the Center, where many children studied, developed and trained on the foundation of the Word of God. I participated in the prayer meetings for mothers in the Center, all the time crying out to God for my

                    Soon my grandmother started to attend the Word of Life Church. She learned about the Development Center and asked them to involve us as well. We liked the Center from the very first day; we studied with much difficulty, but the dedication and love of the teachers toward us made us start everything anew.
