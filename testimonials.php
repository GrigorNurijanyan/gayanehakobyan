and my parents were preparing all the necessary documents for my school, 
they took me to a medical examination, which showed that I had poor 
eyesight. Even my parents had not noticed it. The doctor told us that my
right eye saw only for 30%, and of my left eye for 20%. They also 
diagnosed me with astigmatism, which is considered an incurable disease.  </p>
