                    <h2>A PRAYER SCHOOL</h2>
                    <p>Social Service Center holds regular prayer meetings, but it also has a three-month Prayer School. Both our volunteers and thօse who are helped by the ministry study in the Prayer School, as the Word of God orders: “…to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke.” (Isaiah 58:6-7)</p>
                    <p>Only through prayer one can break the shackles of poverty, destroy the yoke of violence and receive healing of body, spirit and soul. In the Prayer School, the students study the subject of faith, as without faith it is impossible to receive an answer to any prayer: “But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.” (Hebrew 11:6), but moreover, they also learn to pray in the right way.</p>
                    <p>Prayer is fellowship and friendship with God. It has immense power. It is active and is necessary in our Christian life.</p>
                    <p>Prayer is a lifestyle. Prayer for our spiritual life is like breathing for our body. What will happen if we stop breathing is evident: we will die. Prayer is the breath of God, which gives life and freshness to our spirit and to our relationship with God. It also sustains our freedom and gives us power to fight the enemy. That is why each believer must pray.</p>
                    <p>Many ask why it is necessary to pray to receive something. God has given us free will, so we must direct our desires and heartfelt supplications to Him, so that He can interfere in our lives.</p>
                    <p>John 16:24 tells us: “Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.”</p>
                    <p>Each person is called to pray. It is the gift of Jesus. He always answers to requests of the righteous.</p>
                    <p>«“Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit”. James 5:17, 18</p>
                    <p>The Bible tells in the Book of Revelation that prayers of the saints are like fragrant incense before God’s throne. We thank God that Jesus went to the cross and rose from the dead, as in this way, He paid for everything we need. By praying, we break through the opposition of evil spirits and have manifestation of God’s will in our lives to carry out His plan on the earth. It is through prayer that His power is released, to fulfill what we ask for, that people might be free from the power and bondage of darkness, the works of the devil might be destroyed and needs of people met. Prayer can change a lot; however, it is not prayer in itself that brings change, but:</p>
                    <p>Prayer of faith <br>“And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” Matthew 21:22</p>
                    <p>Prayer based on the Word of God <br>When we approach God in prayer, we must clearly acknowledge who He is and what He can do, that is we must understand His greatness.</p>
                    <p>He is the God Who created the heavens and the earth and everything that exists and has life in itself. He has always been and will always be. Therefore, we give Him gratitude and glory. The Lord’s Prayer starts with praise:</p>
                    <p>“Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.” Matthew 6:9</p>
                    <p>We pray to God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>Jesus has already paid for our salvation on the cross. He has saved us not only from hell, but also from any situation that can arise in our lives.</p>
                    <p>“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Galatians 3:13, 14</p>
                    <p>Everything is already accomplished in heaven; we must only agree with Him in our prayers.</p>
                    <p>Prayer is not only a request, but also a living relationship, fellowship with God. We experience His presence; we worship Him and express our gratitude to Him. The quantity and quality of answered prayers are not measured by verbosity of the praying person or by duration of the prayer, but by intimate and trustful relationship with God and by earnest supplications from our hearts.</p>
                    <p>There are different types of prayer. It is impossible to mix al of them together, and there is no recipe of prayer for each situations. We cannot play football with a hockey stick. If we follow the Holy Spirit, He will help us to pray in different ways and manners, as He leads us according to the Word of God.</p>
                    <p>«“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.” (Ephesians 6:18)»</p>
                    <p>According to the teachings of Mary Alice and Kenneth Hagin, prayers are as follows:</p>
                    <p>Prayer of faith; <br>Prayer of consecration, holiness and obedience; <br>Prayer of casting our cares upon God; <br>Group prayer; <br>Prayer of praise and worship; <br>Prayer of agreement; <br>Prayer of repentance; <br>Prayer of intercession; <br>Prayer in tongues; <br>Prayer of travail; <br>Prayer of request, etc. <br>Prayer of repentance is said at spiritual birth, when a person repents and receives Jesus Christ as his Savior. God has given us this prayer to use during our entire Christian life, not to be saved again and again, but to keep our hearts and lives pure before God.</p>
                    <p>The word ‘repent’ means ‘to experience a change’ that is to turn and to take another direction.</p>
                    <p>“Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord…” Acts 3.19, 20</p>
                    <p>Prayer of repentance is very important, as when we repent, we receive forgiveness the very moment, and a rebirth starts in that specific sphere of our life.</p>
                    <p>We already mentioned that faith is a key factor to any prayer, but there is a specific prayer, Prayer of faith, by which we pray for ourselves, our loved ones and relatives, unless we receive a Word, and when we receive it, we start to proclaim it, standing in faith.</p>
                    <p>«“Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. For she said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well”. Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.” (Mark 5:25-29)</p>
                    <p>This woman, having received a revelation in her heart, proclaimed with faith: “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”, and received healing.</p>
                    <p>When we pray for others, it is Prayer of intercession. Jesus intercedes in heaven, and we as priests intercede on the earth.</p>
                    <p>“But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.” (Hebrews 7:24-25)</p>
                    <p>“Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.” (1 Timothy 2:1)</p>
                    <p>Prayer of faith is different from Prayer of intercession. We pray not only for ourselves, but for our loved ones and relatives as well. And if intercessory prayer is prayed until a result is evident, prayer of faith is not prayed long, but until we receive a word and start confessing it in faith.</p>
                    <p>Prayer in tongues is the prayer of the Holy Spirit to God. Due to this fellowship, we become sensitive toward the source of the tongues, the Holy Spirit, and understand how and when to use this gift.</p>
                    <p>When we pray in tongues, we receive new revelations, plans and ideas from God. <br>We can pray in tongues for a specific goal. <br>Tongues of the Holy Spirit are also used as a spiritual weapon. <br>Of course, we can make our requests and needs known by praying in our language, and God will hear them through the Holy Spirit.</p>
                    <p>No matter what the devil uses against us; God has a weapon to overcome the enemy. Praying in tongues is one of these weapons. The power that stands behind praying in tongues is the Holy Spirit. He is the Weapon. Jesus Himself said that He drove demons by the Holy Spirit (Matthew 12:28). You have the same Holy Spirit. Pray in tongues, join God’s gifts and weapons, and use them against the enemy, the devil!</p>
                    <p>“Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.” Romans 8:26, 27</p>
                    <p>Through Prayer of consecration, we give our life to God so that He can use it for His purposes. In this prayer, we say: “If it is Your will”.</p>
                    <p>“Saying, ‘Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.’” (Luke 22:42)</p>
                    <p>Through Prayer of casting our cares, we give all our cares to God: “Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7)</p>
                    <p>Prayer of worship: “And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.” (Luke 24:52-53)</p>
                    <p>Prayer of agreement: “Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:19-20)</p>
                    <p>One Accord Prayer: “And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. 24 So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: “Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them, 25 who by the mouth of Your servant David[a] have said: ‘Why did the nations rage, And the people plot vain things? The kings of the earth took their stand, And the rulers were gathered together Against the Lord and against His Christ.’ “For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, 30 by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.” And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:23-31)</p>
                    <p>Prayer of Request: “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)</p>
                    <p>In Prayer of travail, God uses us to do new things on the earth. We do not pray “Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10) in vain, do we?</p>
                    <p>Before speaking about Prayer of warfare, it is important to remember once again, that Jesus has already paid the price. He has taken all the authority from the enemy and has made a spectacle of him.</p>
                    <p>“Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.” Colossians 2.15</p>
                    <p>Jesus said after His resurrection: “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.” (Matthew 28:18)</p>
                    <p>God endowed the man created in His image and likeness with authority to subdue and have dominion (Genesis 1:28). That authority was stolen by the devil, but because of the victory, which Jesus won on the cross, it is given back to the Church.</p>
                    <p>According to Kenneth Hagin, the most dangerous enemy, which succeeds in oppressing the Church, is distorted mentality about spiritual warfare, as well as distorted faith. We need to take the stand that we have according to the Scriptures, the one against a defeated foe. We are God’s army, the army that has His authority, the army that invaded the territory of the enemy, and the army that carries out the victory of our Chief Commander, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>At Prayer of warfare, the battlefield is our mentality; first of all, we fight for our faith, and when our faith arises, we demand from the enemy the promises, which belong to us, with authority and in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>We have authority in the name of Jesus to overcome and to change both our and our loved ones’ lives. Using the name of Jesus in our prayers, we can bind and loose the devil’s influence over people’s lives. We have authority in the name of Jesus even to change courses of entire nations, of course according to God’s will. As Christians, we have authority in the name of Jesus Christ to bind the devil’s forces in political field and to demand from the devil to take his hands off from a country’s political, economic and social life. When the Body of Jesus is praying, more is taking place in heaven (in the first and the second heavens, where demons operate) than we can imagine. Will angels overcome in heaven or not? It depends on us, on our words and prayers for specific situations, which we proclaim here on earth.</p>
                    <p>In a vision of Kenneth Hagin, Jesus taught him: “You take authority over the first three classes of demons, and I will take care over the spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

                    <p>Principalities, powers and the rulers of the darkness of 
                        this world are demonic classes, which have direct influence
                        over our lives, because they rule in the territory where 
                        we live. Here on earth we can bind them and take 
                        authority over them in the name of Jesus. And if we use 
                        our authority in Christ, Jesus will deal with the spiritual 
                        wickedness in high places.</p>
                    <p>“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Matthew 18:18</p>
                    <p>“But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through 
                        our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, 
                        be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work 
                        of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in 
                        the Lord.” 1 Corinthians 15:57-58</p>
