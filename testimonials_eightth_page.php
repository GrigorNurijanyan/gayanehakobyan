                        I am Edgar Meloyan. When I was three years old, I fell from my bike while playing outside. As a result, I damaged my jaw and gum, and broke my frontal teeth. I was taken to a dental clinic, and a dentist removed my broken milk teeth. As it was done very prematurely, soon ugly teeth started to grow in their place; they got bigger and bigger. They did not only appear ugly and giant in my little mouth, but also prevented the normal growth of other teeth. In addition, because of them, I could not fully close my mouth.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                    When I turned six and went to school, my classmates used to make fun of me a lot. Because of my unusually big teeth, they called me “Tooth”. I became even more isolated because of that. I tried not to associate with anyone. From those years, I had a secret dream that was always in my heart. I dreamed about a day when I too would have beautiful, symmetrical teeth. My mother was very troubled because of me and made many inquiries with dentists about correcting my teeth. However, because the treatment was very expensive, and we could not afford it, having beautiful teeth continued to remain a dream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Along with the school, I attended the Development Center of “Go and See…” Social Ministry, where they taught that God Who created the Universe is good and He answers prayers of faith. I received boldness to pray for my dream to come true. The next day I was overjoyed! A doctor came and invited me to his dental clinic to work on correction of my teeth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the Development Center, we were staging a play based on the tale “Little Prince”, and I received the leading role. I already had dental braces, and my teeth were being corrected. With the help of my teachers, I overcame all the difficulties, and we had a wonderful play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Thank God for His blessing!
                    </p>
