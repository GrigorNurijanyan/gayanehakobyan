                    <h2>A MOBILE DINING ROOM</h2>
                    <p>In cooperation with Administrative District of Arabkir in Yerevan, we have carried out ‘The Movable Canteen’ program, distributing food to 400 people 3 times a week. Among the participants, there were students, representatives of professional classes, lonely old people and disabled people, who were in adverse social conditions.</p>
                    <p>The advantage of ‘the Movable Canteen’ was that the products (meat, vegetables, fruit, and sweets) were distributed to each home. The addresses were provided to the Ministry by the Social Department of the Administrative District of Arabkir.</p>
                    <h2>TESTIMONIES</h2>
                    <p>
                        There was no light, no water, and the worst was that there was no hope. A group of young men came to our house on such a cold and dark day. To my surprise, N. It turned out that the mayor had learned of my social conditions and decided to help me every weekend bringing so much food to be provided with hot meals and various foods throughout the week. Before that I had not even heard of God, but today I give glory to Him that in distress he came to my aid and revealed his existence.

                    <p>My parents didn't work because there was no work, and they couldn't trade outside. We had a lot of hungry days. We learned that young men who believed in God had come. Later we met them often at our house. We give glory to God that during those narrow years he helped us. Thank you also for those young men, both in winter and in winter. In the cold and in the heat of summer, they volunteered in the church, and because of the lack of transportation, they often walked from house to house and delivered food to many and many people like us.
